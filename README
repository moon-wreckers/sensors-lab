Assignment Description:

Implementation detials and references:
Stepper motor driver Detail:
CAUTION: DO NOT REWIRE while the system (motor/ driver is powered)
- Pololu  (A4988 stepper motor driver)
- Allegro’s A4988 DMOS Microstepping Driver with Translator and Overcurrent Protection
- Been in use since 2009 (LTE)
- Over current and over temperature protection of the driver module
- five different micro-stepping resolutions (upto 1/16)
- Operating range 8V to 35V and upto 1A (w/o heat sink)
- can control one bi-polar stepper motor 2A o/p current per coil
- Requires a supply voltage of 3 to 5.5V across VDD and GND
- 8 to 35V across VMOT and GND
- supply has to have appropriate decoupling capacitors (close to the board), able to deliver peak current of 4A
- CAUTION: using power leads longer than a few inches - can cause spikes exceeding the 35V rating 
- SOLUTION: put a large (at least 47 µF) electrolytic capacitor across (VMOT) and GND close to the board
